# h5p-svelte

This is a template for creating h5p-content using Svelte

## Customize
Replace the following strings to make this your own
- `H5P-Svelte` -> `Org-PackageName` This is the package name (you must also rename all folders and files that contain this string)
- `h5p-svelte` -> `packagename` This is the common name for the package

## Notes
- The folder `package_template` contains the placeholder content

## Build
```bash
npm install
./bundle.sh     # This will generate the h5p file
```
